# EasyGo: Face Recognition for Seamless Transportation

## Overview
EasyGo is an innovative application designed to revolutionize transportation by eliminating the need for physical cards or phones. Leveraging computer vision, the application recognizes users by their faces and classifies them based on a unique number assigned to each user. This enables seamless rides by simply using facial recognition technology.

The project includes a robust database for storing user images and a real-time detection application built with React.

## Features
- **Face Recognition**: Identify and classify users using advanced computer vision techniques.
- **Real-Time Detection**: A React-based application for real-time face recognition during transportation.
- **User Database**: Securely stores user images and unique IDs.
- **Seamless User Experience**: No need for physical cards or mobile devices; users can simply use their faces to access rides.

## Use Case
EasyGo is specifically designed for transportation systems to:
- Simplify user authentication.
- Reduce dependence on physical cards or mobile apps.
- Enhance security and convenience for passengers.

## Technologies Used
- **Computer Vision**: For face recognition and classification.
- **React**: To build the front-end application for real-time detection.
- **Database**: To store user images and unique IDs securely.
- **Backend**: API integration for communication between the database and the front-end application.

## How It Works
1. **User Registration**: 
   - Each user is assigned a unique number and their image is stored in the database.
   
2. **Face Recognition**:
   - The system captures the user's face in real-time using a camera.
   - The face is matched with stored images in the database.

3. **Classification**:
   - Users are classified based on their unique ID for authentication.

4. **Ride Access**:
   - Upon successful recognition, the system grants the user access to the transportation service.

## Setup and Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/whoisusmanali/EasyGO.git
   cd EasyGO
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
4. Set up the backend and database following the instructions in the `backend/README.md`.
5. Launch the application and test the real-time detection feature.

## Future Enhancements
- Integration with payment gateways for automatic fare deduction.
- Support for multiple transportation networks.
- Improved facial recognition accuracy using deep learning models.
- Enhanced security features like anti-spoofing.
